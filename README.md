# HOW TO PLAY (IMPORTANT):

This is not a regular tower defense game. You're not meant to set down towers and forget about them. You only have one type of tower, and as the game goes on, the amount you have to place down goes up slowly. But even by sixty seconds, you only have four of them. The idea is to **pick them up** using **right-click** and to place them back down again as fast as you can to fend off the Zorgons. It's important to place the towers close to groups of Zorgons, otherwise the bullets take too long to travel and you will lose.

Sorry to be so long-winded about it, but the last thing I want is for people to not know how to play and then rage-quit. :) hope you have fun!
